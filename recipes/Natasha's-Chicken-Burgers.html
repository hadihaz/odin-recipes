    <h3>This top-rated chicken burger recipe is a refreshing change from traditional beef burgers. </h3>
    <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. </p>
    <p>The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>
